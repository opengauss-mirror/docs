# MOT Resource Utilization<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0289900811"></a>

The following figure shows the resource utilization of the test performed on a x86 server with four sockets, 96 cores and 512GB RAM server. It demonstrates that a MOT table is able to efficiently and consistently consume almost all available CPU resources. For example, it shows that almost 100% CPU percentage utilization is achieved for 192 cores and 3.9M tpmC.

-   **tmpC –**  The total amount of time to load the entire database \(per database GB\) is represented by the blue line and the  **TIME \(sec\)**  Y axis on the left.
-   **CPU % Utilization –**  The quantity of database GB throughput per second is represented by the orange line and the  **Throughput GB/sec**  Y axis on the right.
