# MOT Concurrency Control Mechanism<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0289900650"></a>

After investing extensive research to find the best concurrency control mechanism, we concluded that SILO-based on OCC is the best ACID-compliant OCC algorithm for MOT. SILO provides the best foundation for MOT's challenging requirements.

>MOT is fully Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability \(ACID\)-compliant, as described in  [Introduction to MOT](mot-introduction.md).
