# Querying Audit Results<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0289900741"></a>

## Prerequisites<a name="en-us_topic_0283136696_en-us_topic_0237121113_en-us_topic_0059778013_sfe45a1031ec347ba820649c0cec52027"></a>

-   Audit has been enabled.
-   Audit of required items has been enabled.
-   The database is running properly and a series of addition, modification, deletion, and query operations have been executed in the database. Otherwise, no audit result is generated.
-   Audit logs are separately recorded on the database nodes.

## Background<a name="en-us_topic_0283136696_en-us_topic_0237121113_en-us_topic_0059778013_s15667753cb2542158661ae3f96cab067"></a>

-   Only users with the  **AUDITADMIN**  permission can view audit records. For details about database users and how to create users, see  [Users](users.md).
-   The SQL function  **pg\_query\_audit**  is provided by the database for audit query. Its syntax is as follows:

    ```
    pg_query_audit(timestamptz startime,timestamptz endtime,audit_log)
    ```

    **startime**  and  **endtime**  indicate the start time and end time of the audit record, respectively.  **audit\_log**  indicates the physical file path of the queried audit logs. If  **audit\_log**  is not specified, the audit log information of the current instance is queried.

    >![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
    >The difference between the values of the  **startime**  and  **endtime**  parameters indicates the query period, which can be any value ranging from 00:00:00 of the  **startime**  parameter to 23:59:59 of the  **endtime**  parameter. Therefore, the  **startime**  and  **endtime**  parameters must be properly set to ensure that the required audit information is displayed.


## Procedure<a name="en-us_topic_0283136696_en-us_topic_0237121113_en-us_topic_0059778013_s342f3000e10f4c079735155bb32a56a2"></a>

1.  Log in as the OS user  **omm**  to the primary node of the database.
2.  Run the following command to connect to the database:

    ```
    gsql -d postgres -p 8000
    ```

    **postgres**  is the name of the database to be connected, and  **8000**  is the port number of the database primary node.

    If information similar to the following is displayed, the connection succeeds:

    ```
    gsql((openGauss x.x.x build f521c606) compiled at 2021-09-16 14:55:22 commit 2935 last mr 6385 release)
    Non-SSL connection (SSL connection is recommended when requiring high-security)
    Type "help" for help.
    
    openGauss=# 
    ```

3.  Run the following command to query the audit record:

    ```
    openGauss=# select * from pg_query_audit('2024-07-12 08:00:00','2024-07-12 17:00:00');
    ```

    The command output is similar to the following:

    ```
              time          |      type      | result | userid | username  | database  |     client_conninfo     |    object_name    |  detail_info |     node_name     |            thread_id            | local_port | remote_port | sha_code | verify_result
    ------------------------+----------------+--------+--------+-----------+-----------+-------------------------+-------------------+--------------+-------------------+---------------------------------+------------+-------------
    2024-07-12 16:22:43+08 | login_success  | ok     | 10     | omm  | postgres | gsql@::1 | postgres    | login db(postgres) success,the current user is:omm, SSL=off | node1 | 139658603525888@774087763979298 |  5433      | 38964 | 73ead146da25a77ca01fc21204b74de99b55d499756438d0dc090e674d315bca | t
    ```

    This record indicates that user  **omm**  logs in to database  **postgres**  at the time specified by the  **time**  column. After the host specified by  **log\_hostname**  is started and a client is connected to its IP address, the host name found by reverse DNS resolution is displayed following the at sign \(@\) in the value of  **client\_conninfo**.

    >![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
    >SSL information is recorded at the end of the audit log  **detail\_info**.  **SSL=on**  indicates that the client is connected using SSL, and  **SSL=off**  indicates that the client is not connected using SSL.
