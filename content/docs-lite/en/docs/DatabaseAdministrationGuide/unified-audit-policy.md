Traditional audit generates a large number of audit logs, and does not support customized access objects and access source configurations, making it inconvenient for database security administrators to analyze audit logs. However, the unified audit policy allows you to bind resource tags and configure data sources to output audit logs, improving the efficiency of database monitoring by security administrators.
