# Running the INSERT Statement to Insert Data<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0289900427"></a>

Run the  **[INSERT](../SQLReference/insert.md)**  statement to write data into the openGauss database in either of the following ways:

-   Use the client tool provided by the openGauss database to write data into openGauss.

    For details, see  [Inserting Data to Tables](../DatabaseAdministrationGuide/inserting-data-to-tables.md).

-   Connect to the database using the JDBC driver and run the  **INSERT**  statement to write data into the openGauss database.

    For details, see  [Connecting to a Database](../GettingStarted/connecting-to-a-database.md).


You can add, modify, and delete database transactions for the openGauss database.  **INSERT**  is the simplest way to write data. It is applicable to scenarios with small data volume and low concurrency.
