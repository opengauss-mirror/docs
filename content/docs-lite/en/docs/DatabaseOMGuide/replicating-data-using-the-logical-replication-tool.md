# Replicating Data Using the Logical Replication Tool<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000001254215967"></a>

Currently, SDR and DRS support openGauss logical replication. The replication tool extracts logical logs from openGauss and replays them in the peer database. For details about the code of the replication tool that uses JDBC to connect to the database, see  [Example: Logic Replication Code](../Developerguide/example-logic-replication-code.md).
