# Typical SQL Optimization Methods<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0289900236"></a>

SQL optimization involves continuous analysis and trying. Queries are run before they are used for services to determine whether the performance meets requirements. If it does not, queries will be optimized by  [checking the execution plan](introduction-to-the-sql-execution-plan.md)  and identifying the causes. Then, the queries will be run and optimized again until they meet the requirements.
