## Description<a name="section18111828"></a>

Gray upgrade is an online upgrade mode that upgrades all nodes. If only the binary files of the database need to be replaced during the gray upgrade, to minimize the impact on services, the two sets of binary files exist on the same node at the same time, and the soft connection switchover mode is used to switch the process version \(one intermittent disconnection within 10 seconds\).
