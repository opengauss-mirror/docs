## Context<a name="en-us_topic_0287275999_en-us_topic_0237152425_en-us_topic_0059779035_sca8f0f932903424f8ce649c929720f23"></a>

You can determine whether to upgrade the existing system based on the new features provided by the openGauss and the current database status.

Currently, in-place upgrade and gray upgrade are supported. The upgrade modes are classified into major version upgrade and minor version upgrade.

After you select an upgrade mode, the system automatically determines and selects a proper upgrade policy.

In-place upgrade: During the upgrade, services must be stopped and all nodes must be upgraded at a time . (Starting from version 6.0.0, the In-place upgrade function will no longer be maintained, and gray upgrade will be used by default.)

Gray upgrade: supports operations on all service during the upgrade and upgrades all nodes at a time. \(This function is supported in versions later than openGauss 1.1.0.\)

Upgrade of specified nodes: Upgrade a specified node to support full-service operations, you can upgrade some specified nodes first, and then upgrade the remaining nodes (versions later than openGauss 3.1.0 support this function).

Upgrade status query: The upgrade status is automatically recorded after each upgrade operation, and the upgrade status can be queried in real time.

Grayscale upgrade supports progress printing, and the progress is printed according to the process executed by the program.

-   Do not perform the upgrade, scale-out, and scale-in at the same time.
-   Virtual IP addresses are not supported.
-   During the upgrade, do not change the values of the  **wal\_level**,  **max\_connections**,  **max\_prepared\_transactions**, and  **max\_locks\_per\_transaction**  GUC parameters. If the value is changed, the instance fails to be started after the rollback.
-   You are advised to perform upgrade when the database system is idle. You can determine the upgrade time \(for example, holidays\) based on experience.
-   Before the upgrade, ensure that the database is normal. You can run the  **gs\_om -t status**  command to query the database status. If the value of  **cluster\_state**  in the query result is  **Normal**, the database is normal.
-   Ensure that the database mutual trust is normal before the upgrade. You can run the  **ssh hostname**  command on any node to connect to another node for verification. If no password is required for the interconnection between hosts, the mutual trust relationship is normal. \(Generally, the mutual trust relationship is normal when the database is running properly.\)
-   Before and after the upgrade, the database deployment mode \(configuration file\) cannot be changed. Before the upgrade, the deployment mode is verified. If the deployment mode is changed, an error is reported.
-   Ensure that the OS is healthy before the upgrade. You can use the  **gs\_checkos**  tool to check the OS status.
-   Services need to be stopped during in-place upgrade. Online upgrade supports all service operations.
-   The database is running properly and data on the primary DN has been fully synchronized to standby DNs.
-   Do not enable Kerberos during the upgrade.
-   Do not modify the  **version.cfg**  file decompressed from the installation package.
-   If the upgrade fails due to an exception, you need to manually roll back the upgrade. The next upgrade can be performed only after the rollback is successful.
-   If the second upgrade is successful after the rollback, the GUC parameters that are set at the uncommitted stage become invalid.
-   Do not manually set GUC parameters during the upgrade.
-   In gray upgrade, services are interrupted for less than 10s during the upgrade.
-   During the upgrade, ensure that the kernel version is the same as the OM version before OM operations. That is, the kernel code and OM code are from the same software package. If the preinstallation script of an upgrade package is executed but the upgrade fails or the preinstallation script of a baseline package is not executed after the upgrade rollback, the kernel code is inconsistent with the OM code.
-   If new columns are added to the system catalog during the upgrade, you cannot view these new columns by running the  **\\d**  command after the upgrade. However, you can run the  **SELECT**  command to query the new columns.
-   The GUC parameter  **enable\_stream\_replication**  must be set to  **on**  for the upgrade. If this parameter is set to  **off**, the upgrade is not allowed.
-   In gray upgrade, ensure that there are less than 200 concurrent reads and 200 concurrent writes.
-   In a cluster with one primary node and multiple standby nodes, after the cluster is upgraded to a version later than openGauss 1.1.0, if listen_addresses in the configuration file is changed to '*', you need to change values of localport in replconninfo1, ......replconninfo* to the original values plus 5. For example, if the original value is 16000, you need to change it to 16005. Otherwise, the cluster fails to be restarted.
-   You are advised to perform the upgrade when the disk usage of the database node is less than 80%.
-   After execute gs_upgradectl -t auto-upgrade, snapshot generation cannot be performed before it is submitted, that is, snapshot generation cannot be performed during upgrade.

## Parameter Description<a name="en-us_topic_0287275999_en-us_topic_0237152425_en-us_topic_0059779035_sdad8716000e7427a84d26645630bb309"></a>

- -t

  Specifies the  **gs\_upgradectl**  command type.

  Valid value: chose-strategy, auto-upgrade, auto-rollback, and commit-upgrade

- -S

  Upgrade status query.

- -l

  Records log information during the upgrade or rollback.

  Value range: any existing absolute path that can be accessed

  Default value:  **/var/log/gaussdb/**_User name_**/om/gs\_upgradectl-YYYY-MM-DD\_hhmmss.log**

- -?, --help

  Displays help information.

- -V, --version

  Displays version information.

- -X

  Specifies the openGauss configuration file.

  Value range: storage paths of XML files

- --grey

  Perform gray upgrade.

- -h
  upgrade specified and partial nodes, this parameter must be used with --grey.

  Value range: single node or multiple node

- --continue

  upgrade the remaining upgrade, this parameter must be used with --grey.

- --force

  If openGauss is abnormal and does not support normal rollback, use this parameter to perform a forcible rollback.
  (Starting from version 6.0.0, force rollback parameter is no longer maintained.)

- --bypass-stale-check

  By default, the system prohibits upgrading to versions that were released earlier. For instance, it is not permitted to upgrade from version 6.x.x released in 2026 to version 7.0.0 RC1 released in 2025. To bypass the release date verification, the --bypass-stale-check parameter can be used.
