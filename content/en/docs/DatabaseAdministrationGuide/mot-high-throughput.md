The following shows the results of various MOT table high throughput tests.

**Performance**

The following figure shows the results of testing the TPC-C benchmark on a Huawei ARM/Kunpeng server that has two sockets and 128 cores.

Four types of tests were performed –

-   Two tests were performed on MOT tables and another two tests were performed on openGauss disk-based tables.
-   Two of the tests were performed on a Single node \(without high availability\), meaning that no replication was performed to a secondary node. The other two tests were performed on Primary/Secondary nodes \(with high availability\), meaning that data written to the primary node was replicated to a secondary node.

MOT tables are represented in orange and disk-based tables are represented in blue.

The results showed that:

-   As expected, the performance of MOT tables is significantly greater than of disk-based tables in all cases.
-   For a Single Node – 3.8M tpmC for MOT tables versus 1.5M tpmC for disk-based tables
-   For a Primary/Secondary Node – 3.5M tpmC for MOT tables versus 1.2M tpmC for disk-based tables
-   For production grade \(high-availability\) servers \(Primary/Secondary Node\) that require replication, the benefit of using MOT tables is even more significant than for a Single Node \(without high-availability, meaning no replication\).
-   The MOT replication overhead of a Primary/Secondary High Availability scenario is 7% on ARM/Kunpeng and 2% on x86 servers, as opposed to the overhead of disk tables of 20% on ARM/Kunpeng and 15% on x86 servers.

**Performance per CPU core**

The following figure shows the TPC-C benchmark performance/throughput results per core of the tests performed on a Huawei ARM/Kunpeng server that has two sockets and 128 cores. The same four types of tests were performed \(as described above\).

The results showed that as expected, the performance of MOT tables is significantly greater per core than of disk-based tables in all cases. It also shows that for production grade \(high-availability\) servers \(Primary/Secondary Node\) that require replication, the benefit of using MOT tables is even more significant than for a Single Node \(without high-availability, meaning no replication\).

## ARM/Kunpeng 4-Socket 256 Cores<a name="section1510791314715"></a>

The following demonstrates MOT's excellent concurrency control performance by showing the tpmC per quantity of connections.

![](figures/arm-kunpeng-4-socket-256-cores-performance-benchmarks.png "arm-kunpeng-4-socket-256-cores-performance-benchmarks")

The results show that performance increases significantly even when there are many cores and that peak performance of 4.8M tpmC is achieved at 768 connections.

## x86-based Servers<a name="section18708933184717"></a>

-   **8-Socket 384 Cores**

The following demonstrates MOT's excellent concurrency control performance by comparing the tpmC per quantity of connections between disk-based tables and MOT. This test was performed on an x86 server with eight sockets and 384 cores. The orange represents the results of the MOT table.

![](figures/x86-8-socket-384-cores-performance-benchmarks.png "x86-8-socket-384-cores-performance-benchmarks")

The results show that MOT tables significantly outperform disk-based tables and have very highly efficient performance per core on a 386 core server, reaching over 3M tpmC / core.

-   **4-Socket 96 Cores**

3.9 million tpmC was achieved by MOT on this 4-socket 96 cores server. The following figure shows a highly efficient MOT table performance per core reaching 40,000 tpmC / core.
