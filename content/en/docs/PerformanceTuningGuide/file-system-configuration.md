# File System Configuration<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0283136945"></a>

To improve the I/O efficiency of the database, NVMe disks are used as data disks. The file system type is XFS and the data block size is 8 KB. The procedure is as follows:

1.  <a name="en-us_topic_0263913268_li13131455153313"></a>Check the file system type of the current data disk.
    1.  Run the following command to query the attached NVMe disk:

        ```
        df -h | grep nvme
        ```

        The result is as follows:

        ```
        /dev/nvme0n1                3.7T  2.6T  1.2T  69% /data1 
        /dev/nvme1n1                3.7T  1.9T  1.8T  51% /data2 
        /dev/nvme2n1                3.7T  2.2T  1.6T  59% /data3 
        /dev/nvme3n1                3.7T  1.4T  2.3T  39% /data4
        ```

    2.  Run the following command to view the NVMe disk information:

        ```
        xfs_info
        ```

        For example, run the  **xfs\_info /data1**  command. As shown in  [Figure 1](#en-us_topic_0263913268_fig16848819124216), the block size is 8 KB and does not need to be changed. If the block size does not meet the requirement of 8 KB, you need to format the block again. Before formatting, back up the data.

2.  Back up the data on the disk to be modified to other disks or servers.
3.  Format the disk as an XFS file system.

    Take the disk  **/dev/nvme0n1**  whose loading path is  **/data1**  as an example. Run the following command. Perform this step based on the actual situation.

    ```
    umount /data1 
    mkfs.xfs -b size=8192 /dev/nvme0n1 -f 
    mount /dev/nvme0n1 /data1
    ```

4.  Perform  [step 1](#en-us_topic_0263913268_li13131455153313)  and check whether the block size has been changed to 8 KB.
