# Physical Backup and Restoration

### gs\_basebackup

#### Background

After openGauss is deployed, problems and exceptions may occur during database running.  **gs\_basebackup**, provided by openGauss, is used to perform basic physical backup.  **gs\_basebackup**  copies the binary files of the database on the server using a replication protocol. To remotely execute  **gs\_basebackup**, you need to use the system administrator account.  **gs\_basebackup**  supports hot backup and compressed backup.

![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 

-   **gs\_basebackup**  supports only full backup.

-   **gs\_basebackup**  supports hot backup and compressed backup.

-   **gs\_basebackup**  cannot back up tablespaces containing absolute paths on the same server. This is because the absolute path is unique on the same machine, and brings about conflicts. However, it can back up tablespaces containing absolute paths on different machines.

-   If the functions of incremental checkpoint and dual-write are enabled,  **gs\_basebackup**  also backs up dual-write files.

-   If the  **pg\_xlog**  directory is a soft link, no soft link is created during backup. Data is directly backed up to the  **pg\_xlog**  directory in the destination path.

-   If the backup permission is revoked during the backup, the backup may fail or the backup data may be unavailable.

-   openGauss does not support version upgrade.

#### Prerequisites<a name="en-us_topic_0237152406_en-us_topic_0059777806_s9649938409774ccdbc6993a90ccb777a"></a>

-   The openGauss database can be connected.

-   User permissions are not revoked during the backup.

-   In the  **pg\_hba.conf**  file, the replication connection is allowed and the connection is established by a system administrator.

-   If the Xlog transmission mode is  **stream**, the number of  **max\_wal\_senders**  must be configured to at least one.

-   If the Xlog transmission mode is  **fetch**, the  **wal\_keep\_segments**  parameter must be set to a large value so that logs are not removed before the backup ends.

-   During the restoration, backup files exist in the backup directory on all the nodes. If backup files are lost on any node, copy them to it from another node.

#### Parameter Description<a name="en-us_topic_0237152406_en-us_topic_0059777806_s2fa71feeaad041f293de868e52bb5907"></a>

The  **gs\_basebackup**  tool can use the following types of parameters:

- -D directory

  Directory for storing backup files. This parameter is mandatory.


- Common parameters

  - -c, --checkpoint=fast|spread

    Sets the checkpoint mode to  **fast**  or  **spread**  \(default\).

  - -l, --label=LABEL

    Adds tags for the backup.

  - -P, --progress

    Enables the progress report.

  - -v, --verbose

    Enables the verbose mode.

  - -V, --version

    Prints the version and exits.

  - -?, --help

    Displays  **gs\_basebackup**  command parameters.

  - -T, –tablespace-mapping=olddir=newdir

    During the backup, the tablespace in the  **olddir**  directory is relocated to the  **newdir**  directory. For this to take effect,  **olddir**  must exactly match the path where the tablespace is located \(but it is not an error if the backup does not contain the tablespaces in  **olddir**\).  **olddir**  and  **newdir**  must be absolute paths. If a path happens to contain an equal sign \(=\), you can escape it with a backslash \(\\\). This option can be used multiple times for multiple tablespaces.

  - -F, –format=plain|tar

    Sets the output format to  **plain**  \(default\) or  **tar**. If this parameter is not set, the default value  **–format=plain**  is used. The plain format writes the output as a flat file, using the same layout as the current data directory and tablespace. When the cluster has no extra tablespace, the entire database is placed in the target directory. If the cluster contains additional tablespaces, the primary data directory will be placed in the target directory, but all other tablespaces will be placed in the same absolute path on the server. The tar mode writes the output as a tar file in the target directory. The primary data directory is written to a file named  **base.tar**, and other tablespaces are named after their OIDs. The generated .tar package must be decompressed using the  **gs\_tar**  command.

  - -X, –xlog-method=fetch|stream

    Sets the Xlog transmission mode. If this parameter is not set, the default value  **–xlog-method=stream**  is used. The required write-ahead log files \(WALs\) are included in the backup. This includes all WALs generated during the backup. In fetch mode, WAL files are collected at the end of the backup. Therefore, the  **wal\_keep\_segments**  parameter must be set to a large value so that logs are not removed before the backup ends. If it has been rotated when the log is to be transmitted, the backup fails and is unavailable. In stream mode, WALs are streamed when a backup is created. This will open a second connection to the server and start streaming WALs while the backup is running. Therefore, it will use up to two connections configured by the  **max\_wal\_senders**  parameter. As long as the client can receive WALs, no additional WALs need to be stored on the host.

  - -x, –xlog

    Equivalent to using  **-X**  with the fetch method.

  - -Z –compress=level

    Enables gzip compression for the output of the tar file and sets the compression level \(0 to 9, where 0 indicates no compression and 9 indicates the best compression\). The compression is available only when the tar format is used. The suffix .gz is automatically added to the end of all .tar file names.

  - -z

    Enables gzip compression for tar file output and uses the default compression level. The compression is available only when the tar format is used. The suffix .gz is automatically added to the end of all .tar file names.

  - -t, –rw-timeout

    Sets the checkpoint time limit during backup. The default value is 120s. If the full checkpoint of the database is time-consuming, you can increase the value of  **rw-timeout**.


- Connection parameters

  - -h, --host=HOSTNAME

    Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server is running or the directory for the Unix-domain socket.

  - -p, --port=PORT

    Specifies the port number of the database server.

    You can modify the default port number using this parameter.

  - -U, --username=USERNAME

    Specifies the user that connects to the database.

  - -s, --status-interval=INTERVAL

    Specifies the time for sending status packets to the server, in seconds.

  - -w,--no-password

    Never issues a password prompt.

  - -W, --password

    Issues a password prompt when the  **-U**  parameter is used to connect to a local or remote database.

#### Restoring Data from Backup Files<a name="en-us_topic_0249632270_section161121221193110"></a>

If a database is faulty, restore it from backup files.  **gs\_basebackup**  backs up the database in binary mode. Therefore, you can directly copy and replace the original files or start the database on the backup database.

![](F:/opengauss-docs/docs/content/en/docs/Administratorguide/public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   

-   If the current database instance is running, a port conflict may occur when you start the database from the backup file. In this case, you need to modify the port parameter in the configuration file or specify a port when starting the database.  
-   If the current backup file is a primary/standby database, you may need to modify the replication connections between the master and slave databases, such as,  **replconninfo1**  and  **replconninfo2**  in the  **postgresql.conf**  file.  
-   If the data_directory parameter in the postgresql.conf configuration file is enabled and configurd and the backup directory is used to start the database, the database fails to be started because the value of data_directory isdifferent from the backup directory. You can change the value of data_directory to a new data directory or comment out this parameter.

To restore the original database, perform the following steps:

1.  Stop the database server. For details, see  *Administrator Guide*.
2.  Copy the original database and all tablespaces to another location for future use.
3.  Delete all or part of the files from the original database.
4.  Use the database system user rights to restore the required database files from the backup.
5.  If a link file exists in the database, modify the link file so that it can be linked to the correct file.
6.  Restart the database server and check the database content to ensure that the database is restored to the required status.

![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   

-   Incremental restoration from backup files is not supported.   
-   After the restoration, check that the link file in the database is linked to the correct file.  


### PITR Recovery

#### Background<a name="section1093619499159"></a>

When a database breaks down or needs to be rolled back to a previous state, the point-in-time recovery \(PITR\) function of openGauss can be used to restore the database to any point in time after the backup and archive data is generated.

![](F:/opengauss-docs/docs/content/en/docs/Administratorguide/public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   

-   PITR can only be restored to a point in time after the physical backup data is generated.  
-   Only the primary node can be restored using PITR. The standby node needs to be fully built to synchronize data with the primary node.  

#### Prerequisites<a name="section5133181313201"></a>

-   Full data files have been physically backed up.
-   WAL log files have been archived.

#### PITR Recovery Process<a name="section162231757172114"></a>

1.  Replace the target database directory with the physical backup files.
2.  Delete all files in the database directory  **pg\_xlog/**.
3.  Copy the archived WAL log file to the  **pg\_xlog**  file. \(Or you can configure  **restore\_command**  in the  **recovery.conf**  file to skip this step.\)
4.  Create the recovery command file  **recovery.conf**  in the database directory and specify the database recovery degree.
5.  Start the database.
6.  Connect to the database and check whether the database is recovered to the expected status.
7.  If the expected status is reached, run the  **pg\_xlog\_replay\_resume\(\)**  command so that the primary node can provide services externally.

#### Configuring the recovery.conf File<a name="section1847655332317"></a>

**Archive Recovery Configuration**

-   restore\_command = string

The  **shell**  command is used to obtain the archived WAL files among the WAL file series. Any %f in the string is replaced by the name of the file to retrieve from the archive, and any %p is replaced by the path name to copy it to on the server. Any %r is replaced by the name of the file containing the last valid restart point.

For example:

```
restore_command = 'cp /mnt/server/archivedir/%f %p'
```

-   archive\_cleanup\_command = string

This option parameter declares a  **shell**  command that is executed each time the system is restarted.  **archive\_cleanup\_command**  provides a mechanism for deleting unnecessary archived WAL files from the standby database. Any %r is replaced by the name of the file containing the last valid restart point. That is the earliest file that must be kept to allow recovery to be restartable, so all files older than %r can be safely removed.

For example:

```
archive_cleanup_command = 'pg_archivecleanup /mnt/server/archivedir %r'
```

If multiple standby servers need to be recovered from the same archive path, ensure that WAL files are not deleted from any standby server before the recovery.

-   recovery\_end\_command = string

This parameter is optional and is used to declare a  **shell**  command that is executed only when the recovery is complete.  **recovery\_end\_command**  provides a cleanup mechanism for future replication and recovery.

**Recovery Object Configuration**

-   recovery\_target\_name = string

This parameter declares that the name is recovered to a recovery point created using pg\_create\_restore\_point\(\).

For example:

```
recovery_target_name = 'restore_point_1'
```

-   recovery\_target\_time = timestamp

This parameter declares that the name is recovered to a specified timestamp.

For example:

```
recovery_target_time = '2020-01-01 12:00:00'
```

-   recovery\_target\_xid = string

This parameter declares that the name is recovered to a transaction ID.

For example:

```
recovery_target_xid = '3000'
```

-   recovery\_target\_lsn = string

This parameter declares that the name is recovered to the LSN specified by log.

For example:

```
recovery_target_lsn = '0/0FFFFFF'
```

-   recovery\_target\_inclusive = boolean

This parameter declares whether to stop the recovery after the recovery target is specified \(**true**\) or before the recovery target is specified \(**false**\). This declaration supports only the recovery targets  **recovery\_target\_time**,  **recovery\_target\_xid**, and  **recovery\_target\_lsn**.

For example:

```
recovery_target_inclusive = true
```

![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   

-   Only one of the four configuration items  **recovery\_target\_name**,  **recovery\_target\_time**,  **recovery\_target\_xid**, and  **recovery\_target\_lsn**  can be used at a time.  
-   If no recovery targets are configured or the configured target does not exist, data is recovered to the latest WAL log point by default.  

### gs\_probackup

#### Background<a name="en-us_topic_0289899221_en-us_topic_0287276008_section779474172017"></a>

**gs\_probackup**  is a tool used to manage openGauss database backup and restoration. It periodically backs up the openGauss instances so that the server can be restored when the database is faulty.

-   It supports the physical backup of a standalone database, a primary node, or a standby node of the primary node database.
-   It supports the backup of contents in external directories, such as script files, configuration files, log files, and dump files.
-   It supports incremental backup, periodic backup, and remote backup.
-   It supports settings on the backup retention policy.

#### Prerequisites<a name="en-us_topic_0289899221_en-us_topic_0287276008_section95951827112520"></a>

-   The openGauss database can be connected.
-   To use PTRACK incremental backup, manually add  **enable\_cbm\_tracking = on**  to  **postgresql.conf**.
-   To prevent Xlogs from being cleared before the transmission is complete, increase the value of  **wal\_keep\_segments**  in the  **postgresql.conf**  file.

#### Important Notes<a name="en-us_topic_0289899221_en-us_topic_0287276008_section6439171332614"></a>

-   The backup must be performed by the user who runs the database server.
-   The major version number of the database server to be backed up must be the same as that of the database server to be restored.
-   To back up a database in remote mode using SSH, install the database of the same major version on the local and remote hosts, and run the  **ssh-copy-id remote\_user@remote\_host**  command to set an SSH connection without a password between the local host backup user and the remote host database user.
-   In remote mode, only the subcommands  **add-instance**,  **backup**, and  **restore**  can be executed.
-   Before running the  **restore**  subcommand, stop the gaussdb process.
-   If a user-defined tablespace exists, add the  **--external-dirs**  parameter when backing up the tablespace. Otherwise, the tablespace will not be backed up.
-   If a large amount of data needs to be backed up, adjust the values of  **session\_timeout**  and  **wal\_sender\_timeout**  in the  **postgresql.conf**  file to prevent backup timeout. In addition, adjust the value of  **--rw-timeout**  in the backup command line parameters.
-   When using the  **-T**  option to redirect the external directory in the backup to a new directory during restoration, specify the  **--external-mapping**  parameter.
-   After an incremental backup is restored, the created logical replication slot is unavailable and needs to be deleted and recreated.
-   When remote backup is used, ensure that the clock of the remote server is synchronized with that of the backup server. Otherwise,  **gaussdb**  may fail to be started when  **--recovery-target-time**  is used for restoration.
-   When remote backup is valid \(**remote-proto=ssh**\), ensure that  **-h**  and  **--remote-host **specify the same server. When remote backup is invalid, if the  **-h**  option is specified, ensure that  **-h**  specifies the local address or local host name.
-   Currently, logical replication slots cannot be backed up.

#### Command Description<a name="en-us_topic_0289899221_en-us_topic_0287276008_section86861610172816"></a>

  Displays progress.

- --note=*text*

  Adds a note to the backup.


**Backup-related parameters**

- -b  *backup-mode*, --backup-mode=*backup-mode*

  Specifies the backup mode. The value can be  **FULL**  or  **PTRACK**.

  **FULL**: creates a full backup. The full backup contains all data files.

  **PTRACK**: creates a PTRACK incremental backup.

- -C, --smooth-checkpoint

  Expands checkpoints within a period of time. By default,  **gs\_probackup**  attempts to complete checkpoints as soon as possible.

- -S  *slot-name*, --slot=*slot-name*

  Specifies the replication slot for WAL stream processing.

  Creates a temporary physical replication slot for WAL stream processing in the backup instance to ensure that all required WAL segments are still available during the backup.

  The default slot name is  **pg\_probackup\_slot**, which can be changed using the  **--slot/-S**  option.

- --backup-pg-log

  Includes the log directory in the backup. This directory typically contains log messages. By default, the log directory is not included. If the default log path is changed, you can use the  **-E**  parameter to back up log files. The following describes how to use the  **-E**  parameter.

- -E  *external-directories-paths*, --external-dirs=*external-directories-paths*

  Includes the specified directory in the backup. This option is useful for backing up scripts in external data directories, sql dumps, and configuration files. To back up multiple external directories, use colons \(:\) to separate their paths in Unix.

  Example: -E /tmp/dir1:/tmp/dir2

- --skip-block-validation

  Disables block-level verification to speed up backup.

- --no-validate

  Skips the automatic verification when the backup is complete.

- --external-mapping=*OLDDIR=NEWDIR*

  During restoration, the external directory contained in the backup is moved from  **OLDDIR **to  **NEWDIR**.  **OLDDIR**  and  **NEWDIR**  must be absolute paths. If the path contains an equal sign \(=\), use a backslash \(\\\) to escape. This option can be specified for multiple directories.

- -T  *OLDDIR=NEWDIR*, --tablespace-mapping=*OLDDIR=NEWDIR*

  Relocates the tablespace from the  **OLDDIR**  directory to the  **NEWDIR**  directory during the restoration.  **OLDDIR**  and  **NEWDIR**  must be absolute paths. If the path contains an equal sign \(=\), use a backslash \(\\\) to escape. This parameter can be specified multiple times for multiple tablespaces. This parameter must be used together with  **--external-mapping**.

- --skip-external-dirs

  Skips the external directories in the backup that are specified using the  **--external-dirs**  option. The contents of these directories will not be restored.

- --skip-block-validation

  Skips block-level verification to speed up verification. During the automatic verification before the restoration, only file-level verification is performed.

- --no-validate

  Skips the backup verification.

- --force

  Specifies the invalid state that allows ignoring backup. This flag can be used if data needs to be restored from a damaged or invalid backup. Exercise caution when using it.


**Recovery objective-related parameters \(recovery\_options\)**

>![](F:/opengauss-docs/docs/content/en/docs/Administratorguide/public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
>Currently, continuous WAL archiving PITR cannot be configured. Therefore, parameter usage is restricted as follows:
>To use continuously archived WAL logs for PITR, perform the following steps:
>
>1.  Replace the target database directory with the physical backup files.
>2.  Delete all files in the database directory  **pg\_xlog/**.
>3.  Copy the archived WAL log file to the  **pg\_xlog**  file. \(Or you can configure  **restore\_command**  in the  **recovery.conf**  file to skip this step.\)
>4.  Create the recovery command file  **recovery.conf**  in the database directory and specify the database recovery degree.
>5.  Start the database.
>6.  Connect to the database and check whether the database is recovered to the expected status. If the expected status is reached, run the  **pg\_xlog\_replay\_resume\(\)**  command so that the primary node can provide services externally.

- --recovery-target-lsn=*lsn*

  Specifies LSN to be restored. Currently, only the backup stop LSN can be specified.

>The following parameters can be used together with the  **backup**  and  **delete**  commands.

- --retention-redundancy=*retention-redundancy*

  Number of full backups retained in the data directory. The value must be a positive integer. The value  **0**  indicates that the setting is disabled.

  Default value:  **0**

- --retention-window=*retention-window*

  Specifies the retention period. The value must be a positive integer. The value  **0**  indicates that the setting is disabled.

  Default value:  **0**

- --wal-depth=*wal-depth*

  Latest number of valid backups that must be retained on each timeline to perform the PITR capability. The value must be a positive integer. The value  **0**  indicates that the setting is disabled.

**Fixed backup-related parameters \(pinning\_options\)**

>![](F:/opengauss-docs/docs/content/en/docs/Administratorguide/public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
>To exclude certain backups from the established retention policy, you can use the following parameters with the  **backup**  and  **set-backup**  commands.

- --ttl=*interval*

  Specifies a fixed amount of time to back up data from the restoration time. The value must be a positive integer. The value  **0**  indicates that the backup is canceled.

  Supported unit: ms, s, min, h, d \(default value:  **s**\)

  For example,  **--ttl=30d**.

- --expire-time=*time*

  Specifies the timestamp when the backup is invalid. The time stamp must comply with the ISO-8601 standard.

  For example,  **--expire-time='2020-01-01 00:00:00+03'**.


**Log-related parameters \(logging\_options\)**

Log levels:  **verbose**,  **log**,  **info**,  **warning**,  **error**, and  **off**.

- --log-level-console=*log-level-console*

  Sets the level of logs to be sent to the console. Each level contains all the levels following it. A higher level indicates fewer messages sent. If this parameter is set to  **off**, the log recording function of the console is disabled.

  Default value:  **info**

- --log-level-file=*log-level-file*

  Sets the level of logs to be sent to the log file. Each level contains all the levels following it. A higher level indicates fewer messages sent. If this parameter is set to  **off**, the log file recording function is disabled.

  Default value:  **off**

- --log-filename=*log-filename*

  Specifies the name of the log file to be created. The file name can use the strftime mode. Therefore,  **%-escapes**  can be used to specify the file name that changes with time.

  For example, if the  **pg\_probackup-%u.log**  mode is specified, pg\_probackup generates a log file each day of the week, with  **%u**  replaced by the corresponding decimal number, that is,  **pg\_probackup-1.log**  indicates Monday.  **pg\_probackup-2.log**  indicates Tuesday, and so on.

  This parameter is valid if the  **--log-level-file**  parameter is specified to enable log file recording.

  Default value:  **"pg\_probackup.log"**

- --error-log-filename=*error-log-filename*

  Specifies the name of the log file that is used only for error logs. The specifying method is the same as that of the  **--log-filename**  parameter.

  It is used for troubleshooting and monitoring.

- --log-directory=*log-directory*

  Specifies the directory where log files are created. The value must be an absolute path. This directory is created when the first log is written.

  Default value:  **$BACKUP\_PATH/log**

- --log-rotation-size=*log-rotation-size*

  Specifies the maximum size of a log file. If the maximum size is reached, the log file will be circulated after the  **gs\_probackup**  command is executed. The  **help**  and  **version**  commands will not lead to a log file circulation. The value  **0**  indicates that the file size-based loop is disabled.

  The unit can be KB, MB, GB, or TB. The default unit is  **KB**.

  Default value:  **0**

- --log-rotation-age=*log-rotation-age*

  Maximum life cycle of a log file. If the maximum size is reached, the log file will be circulated after the  **gs\_probackup**  command is executed. The  **help**  and  **version**  commands will not lead to a log file circulation. The  **$BACKUP\_PATH/log/log\_rotation**  directory saves the time of the last created log file. The value  **0**  indicates that the time-based loop is disabled.

  Supported unit: ms, s, min, h, d \(default value:  **min**\)

  Default value:  **0**


**Connection-related parameters \(connection\_options\)**

>![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
>The following parameters can be used together with the  **backup**  command.

- -d  *dbname*, --pgdatabase=*dbname*

  Specifies the name of the database to connect to. This connection is only used to manage the backup process. Therefore, you can connect to any existing database. If this parameter is not specified in the command line, the  *PGDATABASE*  environment variable, or the  **pg\_probackup.conf**  configuration file,  **gs\_probackup**  attempts to obtain the value from the  *PGUSER*  environment variable. If the  *PGUSER*  variable is not set, the value is obtained from the current user name.

  System environment variable:  *$PGDATABASE*

- -h  *hostname*, --pghost=*hostname*

  Specifies the host name of the system on which the server is running. If the value begins with a slash \(/\), it is used as the directory for the UNIX domain socket.

  Default value:  **local socket**

- -p  *port*, --pgport=*p__ort*

  Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file name extension on which the server is listening for connections.

  System environment variable:  *$PGPORT*

  Default value:  **5432**

- -U  *username*, --pguser=*username*

  Specifies the username of the host to be connected.

  System environment variable:  *$PGUSER*

- -w, --no-password

  Never issues a password prompt. The connection attempt fails if the host requires password verification and the password is not provided in other ways. This parameter is useful in batch jobs and the scripts that require no user password.

- -W  *password*, --password=*password*

  User password for database connection. If the host uses the trust authentication policy, the administrator does not need to enter the  **-W**  parameter. If the  **-W**  parameter is not provided and you are not a system administrator, the system will ask you to enter a password.


**Compression-related parameters \(compression\_options\)**

>![](F:/opengauss-docs/docs/content/en/docs/Administratorguide/public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
>The following parameters can be used together with the  **backup**  command.

- --compress-algorithm=*compress-algorithm*

  Specifies the algorithm used to compress data file.

  The value can be  **zlib**,  **pglz**, or  **none**. If  **zlib**  or  **pglz**  is set, compression is enabled. By default, the compression function is disabled.

  Default value:  **none**

- --compress-level=*compress-level*

  Specifies the compression level. Value range: 0–9

  -   **0**  indicates no compression.
  -   **1**  indicates that the compression ratio is the lowest and processing speed the fastest.
  -   **9**  indicates that the compression ratio is the highest and processing speed the slowest.
  -   This parameter can be used together with  **--compress-algorithm**.

  Default value:  **1**

- --compress

  Compresses with  **--compress-algorithm=zlib**  and  **--compress-level=1**.


**Remote mode-related parameters \(remote\_options\)**

>![](/public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
>The following are parameters that remotely run  **gs\_probackup**  through SSH, and can be used together with the  **add-instance**,  **set-config**,  **backup**, and  **restore**  commands.

- --remote-proto=*protocol*

  Specifies the protocol used for remote operations. Currently, only the SSH protocol is supported. Valid value:

  **ssh**: enables the remote backup mode through SSH. This is the default.

  **none**: The remote mode is disabled explicitly.

  If  **--remote-host**  is specified, this parameter can be omitted.

- --remote-host=*destination*

  Specifies the IP address or host name of the remote host to be connected.

- --remote-port=*port*

  Specifies the port number of the remote host to be connected.

  Default value:  **22**

  >
  >-   If the server does not respond due to a temporary network fault,  **gs\_probackup **will exit after waiting for  *archive-timeout*  seconds \(300 seconds is set by default\).
  >-   If the LSN of the standby server is different from that of the primary server, the database continuously updates the following log information. In this case, you need to rebuild the standby server.
  >
  >```
  >LOG: walsender thread shut down
  >LOG: walsender thread started
  >LOG: received wal replication command: IDENTIFY_VERSION

#### Backup Process<a name="en-us_topic_0289899221_en-us_topic_0287276008_section1735727125216"></a>

1. Initialize the backup directory. Create the  **backups/**  and  **wal/**  subdirectories in the specified directory to store backup files and WAL files respectively.

   ```
   gs_probackup init -B backup_dir
   ```

2. Add a new backup instance.  **gs\_probackup**  can store backups of multiple database instances in the same backup directory.

   ```
   gs_probackup add-instance -B backup_dir -D data_dir --instance instance_name
   ```

3. Create a backup for a specified database instance. Before performing an incremental backup, you must create at least one full backup.

   ```
   gs_probackup backup -B backup_dir --instance instance_name -b backup_mode
   ```

4. Restore data from the backup of a specified instance.

   ```
   gs_probackup restore -B backup_dir --instance instance_name -D pgdata-path -i backup_id
   ```
