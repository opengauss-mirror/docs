# Database Connection Control Functions<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0242380569"></a>

Database connection control functions control the connections to GaussDB servers. An application can connect to multiple servers at a time. For example, a client connects to multiple databases. Each connection is represented by a PGconn object, which is obtained from the function PQconnectdb, PQconnectdbParams, or PQsetdbLogin. Note that these functions will always return a non-null object pointer, unless there is too little memory to allocate the PGconn object. The interface for establishing a connection is stored in the PGconn object. The PQstatus function can be called to check the return value for a successful connection.
