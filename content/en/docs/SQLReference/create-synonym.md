## Function<a name="en-us_topic_0283136599_en-us_topic_0237122116_en-us_topic_0059778169_s0867185fef0f4a228532d432b598cb26"></a>

**CREATE SYNONYM**  creates a synonym object. A synonym is an alias of a database object and is used to record the mapping between database object names. You can use synonyms to access associated database objects.

## Precautions<a name="en-us_topic_0283136599_en-us_topic_0237122116_section93413620440"></a>

-   The user of a synonym should be its owner.
-   If the schema name is specified, create a synonym in the specified schema. Otherwise create a synonym in the current schema.
-   Database objects that can be accessed using synonyms include tables, views, functions, and stored procedures.
-   To use synonyms, you must have the required permissions on associated objects.
-   The following DML statements support synonyms:  **SELECT**,  **INSERT**,  **UPDATE**,  **DELETE**,  **EXPLAIN**, and  **CALL**.
-   You are not advised to create synonyms for temporary tables. To create a synonym, you need to specify the schema name of the target temporary table. Otherwise, the synonym cannot be used normally. In addition, you need to run the  **DROP SYNONYM**  command before the current session ends.
-   After an original object is deleted, the synonym associated with the object will not be deleted in cascading mode. If you continue to access the synonym, an error message is displayed, indicating that the synonym has expired.
-   Users granted the CREATE ANY SYNONYM permission can create synonyms in user schemas.
-   Users granted the CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM permission can create public synonyms.
-   Users granted the DROP PUBLIC SYNONYM permission can delete public synonyms.
-   When creating a synonym, if  **PUBLIC**  is specified, the schema name of synonym cannot be specified.
