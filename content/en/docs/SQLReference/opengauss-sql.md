## What Is SQL?<a name="en-us_topic_0283136913_en-us_topic_0237121924_section07961139165815"></a>

SQL is a standard computer language used to control the access to databases and manage data in databases.

SQL provides different statements to enable you to:

-   Query data.
-   Insert, update, and delete rows.
-   Create, replace, modify, and delete objects.
-   Control the access to a database and its objects.
-   Maintain the consistency and integrity of a database.

SQL consists of commands and functions that are used to manage databases and database objects. SQL can also forcibly implement the rules for data types, expressions, and texts. Therefore,  [SQL Reference](SQL-Reference.md)  describes data types, expressions, functions, and operators in addition to SQL syntax.

-   1986: ANSI X3.135-1986, ISO/IEC 9075:1986, SQL-86
-   1989: ANSI X3.135-1989, ISO/IEC 9075:1989, SQL-89
-   1992: ANSI X3.135-1992, ISO/IEC 9075:1992, SQL-92 \(SQL2\)
-   1999: ISO/IEC 9075:1999, SQL:1999 \(SQL3\)
-   2003: ISO/IEC 9075:2003, SQL:2003 \(SQL4\)
-   2011: ISO/IEC 9075:200N, SQL:2011 \(SQL5\)
