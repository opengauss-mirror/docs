## Parameter Description<a name="section5772125023414"></a>

- **name**

    Specifies the name of a subscription whose attributes are to be altered.

- **CONNECTION 'conninfo'**

    Alters the connection attributes initially set by **CREATE SUBSCRIPTION**.

- **ENABLE \(boolean\)**

    Specifies whether a subscription should be actively replicated, or whether it should be just set but not yet started. The default value is **true**.

- **SET \( subscription\_parameter \[= value\] \[, ... \] \)**

  Modifies the parameters set by **CREATE SUBSCRIPTION**. The allowed parameters are **slot\_name** and **synchronous\_commit**.

  -   If **enabled** is set to **false** during subscription creation, **slot\_name** is forcibly set to **NONE**, that is, null. In this case, the replication slot does not exist even if the value of **slot\_name** is specified.
  -   Change the value of **enabled** from **false** to **true**. When the subscription is enabled, the publication side is connected to create a replication slot. If you do not specify the value of **slot\_name**, the default value (subscription name) is used.
  -   If **enabled** is set to **true**, the subscription is in the normal state. In this case, **slot\_name** cannot be left empty, but the name of the replication slot can be changed to a valid name.

- **REFRESH PUBLICATION**

    Obtains the missing table information from the publisher. Tables added to the subscription publication are copied since the last REFRESH PUBLICATION or CREATE SUBSCRIPTION call.

    refresh\_option specifies additional options for the refresh operation. The options are as follows:
    
    copy\_data (boolean)
          Determines whether to copy existing data in the publication that is being subscribed to after copy starts. The default value is **true**. (Tables previously subscribed to will not be copied.)

- **new\_owner**

    Specifies the username of the new owner of a subscription.

- **new\_name**

    Specifies the new name of a subscription.
