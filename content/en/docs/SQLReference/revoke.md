If a non-owner user of an object attempts to  **REVOKE**  permission on the object, the statement is executed based on the following rules:

-   If the user has no permissions whatsoever on the object, the statement will fail outright.
-   If an authorized user has some permissions, only the permissions with authorization options are revoked.
-   If the authorized user does not have the authorization option, the  **REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES**  form will issue an error message. For other forms of statements, if the permission specified in the statement does not have the corresponding authorization option, the statement will issue a warning.

## Parameter Description<a name="en-us_topic_0283137669_en-us_topic_0237122179_en-us_topic_0059779274_s54fe58f3f55f4965a6b9370f9edebfdf"></a>

The keyword  **PUBLIC**  indicates an implicitly defined group that has all roles.

For details about permission types and parameters, see  [Parameter Description](grant.md#en-us_topic_0283137177_en-us_topic_0237122166_en-us_topic_0059778755_s3557d45c54124d86bc3f619358d806f8)  in section "GRANT".

Permissions of a role include the permissions directly granted to the role, permissions inherited from the parent role, and permissions granted to  **PUBLIC**. Therefore, revoking the  **SELECT**  permission for an object from  **PUBLIC**  does not necessarily mean that the  **SELECT**  permission for the object has been revoked from all roles, because the  **SELECT**  permission directly granted to roles and inherited from parent roles remains. Similarly, if the  **SELECT**  permission is revoked from a user but is not revoked from  **PUBLIC**, the user can still run the  **SELECT**  statement.

If  **GRANT OPTION FOR**  is specified, the permission cannot be granted to others, but permission itself is not revoked.

If user A holds the  **UPDATE**  permissions on a table and the  **WITH GRANT OPTION**  and has granted them to user B, the permissions that user B holds are called dependent permissions. When user A's permission or grant option is revoked,  **CASCADE**  must be specified to revoke all dependent permissions.

A user can only revoke permissions that were granted directly by that user. For example, if user A has granted permission with grant option \(**WITH ADMIN OPTION**\) to user B, and user B has in turn granted it to user C, then user A cannot revoke the permission directly from C. However, user A can revoke the grant option held by user B and use  **CASCADE**. In this way, the permission of user C is automatically revoked. For another example, if both user A and user B have granted the same permission to C, A can revoke his own grant but not B's grant, so C will still effectively have the permission.

If the role executing  **REVOKE**  holds permissions indirectly via more than one role membership path, it is unspecified which containing role will be used to execute the statement. In such cases, it is best practice to use  **SET ROLE**  to become the specific role you want to do the  **REVOKE**  as, and then execute  **REVOKE**. Failure to do so may lead to deleting permissions not intended to delete, or not deleting any permissions at all.
