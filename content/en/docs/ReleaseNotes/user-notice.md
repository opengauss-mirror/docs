openGauss is an open-source, secure, and reliable relational OLTP database with ultimate performance. It is released with the Mulan PSL v2 protocol, allowing users to copy, use, modify, and distribute the source code.

The version number of openGauss is named in *X.Y.Z* format. *X.0.0* indicates the LTS version, *X.Y.0* indicates the preview version, and *Z* indicates the patch version. Generally, a preview version and an LTS version are released every year. The preview version is for beta testing. The LTS version is a long-term support version and can be rolled out on a large scale. If major issues need to be resolved, patch versions will be released as required.

The preliminary openGauss lifecycle plans are as follows:

+ The LTS version is released every one year, and the community provides three-year maintenance support.
+ The preview version is released every one year, and the community provides 0.5-year maintenance support.
