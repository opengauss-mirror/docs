gs\_basebackup is used to prepare base backups of a running server, without affecting other database clients.

The MOT checkpoint is fetched at the end of the operation as well. However, the checkpoint's location is taken from  **checkpoint\_dir**  in the source server and is transferred to the data directory of the source in order to back it up correctly.
