Run the  **top**  command to check the memory usage of each node in openGauss and analyze whether a performance bottleneck occurs due to high memory usage.

## Checking Memory Usage<a name="en-us_topic_0237121487_en-us_topic_0073253547_en-us_topic_0040046523_section31350235191024"></a>

You can query the memory usage of the server in the following ways:

Run the  **top**  command to check the memory usage. Then, press  **Shift+M**  to sort memory on each node by memory size.

In the command output, focus on the memory usage \(**%MEM**\) occupied by the processes and the free memory of the system.

The parameters in the command output are described as follows:

-   **total**: size of the total physical memory
-   **used**: size of the used physical memory
-   **free**: size of the free memory
-   **buffers**: size of the virtual memory used by a process
-   **%MEM**: usage of the memory used by a process
-   **VIRT**: size of the virtual memory occupied by a process. The occupied virtual memory can be calculated using  **VIRT**  =  **SWAP**  +  **RES**.
-   **SWAP**: size of the memory that has been transferred to the swap partition
-   **RES**: size of the memory that has not been transferred to the swap partition
-   **SHR**: size of the shared memory

1.  Run the following command as user  **root**  to check the cache usage:

    ```
    free
    ```

    The command output is similar to the following:

    ```
                 total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
    Mem:       8038844    6336184    1702660          0     375896    2880912
    -/+ buffers/cache:    3079376    4959468
    Swap:      4192924          0    4192924
    ```

2.  If the cache usage is too high, run the following command to enable the automatic cache clearing function:

    ```
    sh openGauss-server/src/bin/scripts/run_drop_cache.sh
    ```
    The openGauss-server code download address is `https://gitcode.com/opengauss/openGauss-server.git`

3.  You need to check the execution plan if the memory usage occupied is too high. Focus on the following items:
    -   Whether improper  **JOIN**  sequences exist. For example, if  **JOIN**  is performed for multiple tables, the intermediate result set of the two tables associated preferentially is large during the execution plan execution, resulting in that the final execution cost is high.
