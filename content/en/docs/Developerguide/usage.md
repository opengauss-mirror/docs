Using MOT tables is quite simple and is described in the few short sections below.

openGauss enables an application to use any combination of MOT tables and standard disk-based tables. You can use MOT tables for your most active, high-contention and throughput-sensitive application tables or you can use MOT tables for all your application’s tables.

The following commands describe how to create MOT tables and how to convert existing disk-based tables into MOT tables in order to accelerate an application’s database-related performance. MOT is especially beneficial when applied to tables that have proven to be bottlenecks.
