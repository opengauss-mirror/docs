**Parameter description:**  Specifies the level of information to be written to the WAL. The value cannot be empty or commented out.

This parameter is a POSTMASTER parameter. Set it based on instructions provided in  [Table 1](resetting-parameters.md#en-us_topic_0283137176_en-us_topic_0237121562_en-us_topic_0059777490_t91a6f212010f4503b24d7943aed6d846).

>![](public_sys-resources/icon-notice.gif) **NOTICE:** 
>-   To enable WAL archiving and data streaming replication between primary and standby servers, set this parameter to  **archive**,  **hot\_standby**, or  **logical**.
>-   This parameter can be set to  **minimal**  only in a single-server system. When the parameter value is  **minimal**,  **archive\_mode**  must be set to  **off**,  **hot\_standby**  must be set to  **off**, and  **max\_wal\_senders**  must be set to  **0**. Otherwise, the database startup fails.
>-   If this parameter is set to  **archive**,  **hot\_standby**  must be set to  **off**. Otherwise, the database startup fails. However,  **hot\_standby**  cannot be set to  **off**  in a primary-standby deployment. For details, see the description of the  **hot\_standby**  parameter.

**Value range**: enumerated values

-   **minimal**

    Advantages: Certain bulk operations \(including creating tables and indexes, executing cluster operations, and copying tables\) are safely skipped in logging, which can make those operations much faster.

    Disadvantages: WALs contain only basic information required for recovery from a database server crash or an emergency shutdown. Data cannot be restored from archived WALs.

-   **archive**

    Adds logging required for WAL archiving, supporting the database restoration from archives.

-   **hot\_standby**
    -   Further adds information required to run SQL queries on a standby server and takes effect after a server restart.
    -   To enable read-only queries on a standby server, the  **wal\_level**  parameter must be set to  **hot\_standby**  on the primary server and the same value must be set on the standby server. There are few measurable differences in performance between using  **hot\_standby**  and  **archive**  levels. However, feedback is welcome if any differences in their impacts on product performance are noticeable.

-   logical

    This parameter indicates that WALs support logical replication.


**Default value**:  **hot\_standby**

## fsync<a name="en-us_topic_0283137354_en-us_topic_0237124707_en-us_topic_0059778393_sb6cc47bbe02c47a785c873b1959ad0df"></a>

**Parameter description:**  Specifies whether the openGauss server uses the  **fsync\(\)**  function \(see  **[wal\_sync\_method](#en-us_topic_0283137354_en-us_topic_0237124707_en-us_topic_0059778393_s9fc8bf6fcd2b474d894fc8ee7385fe86)**\) to ensure that updates can be written to disks in a timely manner.

This parameter is a SIGHUP parameter. Set it based on instructions provided in  [Table 1](resetting-parameters.md#en-us_topic_0283137176_en-us_topic_0237121562_en-us_topic_0059777490_t91a6f212010f4503b24d7943aed6d846).

## synchronous\_commit<a name="en-us_topic_0283137354_en-us_topic_0237124707_en-us_topic_0059778393_sc39a5bd106204166ba4660306d302239"></a>

**Parameter description**: Specifies the synchronization mode of the current transaction.

This parameter is a USERSET parameter. Set it based on instructions provided in  [Table 1](resetting-parameters.md#en-us_topic_0283137176_en-us_topic_0237121562_en-us_topic_0059777490_t91a6f212010f4503b24d7943aed6d846).

Generally, logs generated by a transaction are synchronized in the following sequence:

1.  The primary node writes the log content to the local memory.
2.  The primary node writes the logs in the local memory to the local file system.
3.  The primary node flushes logs in the local file system to disks.
4.  The primary node sends the log content to the standby node.
5.  The standby node receives the log content and saves it to the local memory.
6.  The standby node writes logs in the local memory to the local file system.
7.  The standby node flushes logs in the local file system to disks.
8.  The standby node replays logs to complete the incremental update of data files.

**Value range**: enumerated values

-   **on**: The primary node waits for the standby node to flush logs to disks before committing a transaction.
-   **off**: The primary node commits transactions without waiting for the primary node to flush logs to disks. This mode is also called asynchronous commit.
-   **local**: The primary node waits for the primary node to flush logs to disks before committing a transaction. This mode is also called local commit.
-   **remote\_write**: The primary node waits for the standby node to write logs to the file system before committing a transaction. \(The logs do not need to be flushed to disks.\)
-   **remote\_receive**: The primary node waits for the standby node to receive logs before committing a transaction. \(The logs do not need to be written to the file system.\)
-   **remote\_apply**: The primary node waits for the standby node to complete log replay before committing a transaction.
-   **true**: same as  **on**.
-   **false**: same as  **off**.
-   **yes**: same as  **on**.
-   **no**: same as  **off**.
-   **1**: same as  **on**.
-   **0**: same as  **off**.
-   **2**: same as** remote\_apply**.

**Default value**:  **on**

**Parameter description**: Specifies the method used for forcing WAL updates out to disk.

This parameter is a SIGHUP parameter. Set it based on instructions provided in  [Table 1](resetting-parameters.md#en-us_topic_0283137176_en-us_topic_0237121562_en-us_topic_0059777490_t91a6f212010f4503b24d7943aed6d846).

>![](public_sys-resources/icon-notice.gif) **NOTICE:** 
>If  [fsync](#en-us_topic_0283137354_en-us_topic_0237124707_en-us_topic_0059778393_sb6cc47bbe02c47a785c873b1959ad0df)  is set to  **off**, the setting of this parameter does not take effect because WAL file updates will not be forced out to disk.

**Value range**: enumerated values

-   **open\_datasync**  indicates that WAL files are opened with the  **O\_DSYNC**  option.
-   fdatasync indicates that  **fdatasync\(\)**  is called at each commit. \(SUSE 10 and SUSE 11 are supported.\)
-   **fsync\_writethrough**  indicates that  **fsync\(\)**  is called at each commit to force data in the buffer to be written to the disk.

    >![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
    >**wal\_sync\_method**  can be set to  **fsync\_writethrough**  on a Windows platform, but this setting has the same effect as setting the parameter to  **fsync**.

-   **fsync**  indicates that  **fsync\(\)**  is invoked at each commit \(SUSE 10 and SUSE 11 are supported\).
-   **open\_sync**  indicates that the  **open\(\)**  with the O\_SYNC option is used to write WAL files \(SUSE 10 and SUSE 11 are supported\).

    >![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
    >Not all platforms support the preceding parameters.


**Default value:** **fdatasync**

## full\_page\_writes<a name="en-us_topic_0283137354_en-us_topic_0237124707_en-us_topic_0059778393_scf91a0abd76640efb76b172daf9a5f38"></a>

**Parameter description**: Specifies whether the openGauss server writes the entire content of each disk page to WALs during the first modification of that page after a checkpoint. When the incremental checkpoint function and  **enable\_double\_write**  are enabled at the same time,  **full\_page\_writes**  is not used.

This parameter is a SIGHUP parameter. Set it based on instructions provided in  [Table 1](resetting-parameters.md#en-us_topic_0283137176_en-us_topic_0237121562_en-us_topic_0059777490_t91a6f212010f4503b24d7943aed6d846).

>![](public_sys-resources/icon-notice.gif) **NOTICE:** 
>-   This parameter is needed because a page write that is in process during an OS crash might be only partially completed, leading to an on-disk page that contains a mix of old and new data. The row-level change data normally stored in WALs will not be enough to completely restore such a page during post-crash recovery. Storing the full page image guarantees that the page can be correctly restored, but at the price of increasing the amount of data that must be written to WALs.
>-   Setting this parameter to  **off**  might lead to unrecoverable data corruption after a system failure. It might be safe to set this parameter to  **off**  if you have hardware \(such as a battery-backed disk controller\) or file-system software \(such as ReiserFS 4\) that reduces the risk of partial page writes to an acceptably low level.

**Value range**: Boolean

-   **on**  indicates that this feature is enabled.
-   **off**  indicates that this feature is disabled.

**Default value**:  **on**

**Value range**: Boolean

-   **on**  indicates that the entire page is written to WALs.
-   **off**  indicates that the entire page is not written to WALs.

**Default value**:  **on**

## wal\_buffers<a name="en-us_topic_0283137354_en-us_topic_0237124707_en-us_topic_0059778393_sce544e842a94430abad77f1ae64406af"></a>

**Parameter description**: Specifies the number of  **XLOG\_BLCKSZ**  used for storing WAL data. The size of each  **XLOG\_BLCKSZ**  is 8 KB.

This parameter is a POSTMASTER parameter. Set it based on instructions provided in  [Table 1](resetting-parameters.md#en-us_topic_0283137176_en-us_topic_0237121562_en-us_topic_0059777490_t91a6f212010f4503b24d7943aed6d846).

**Value range:**  –1 to 2<sup>18</sup>. The minimum value is –1 and the maximum value is 262144. The unit is 8 KB.

-   If this parameter is set to –1, the value of  **wal\_buffers**  is automatically adjusted to 1/64 of  **shared\_buffers**. The minimum value is 8  **XLOG\_BLCKSZ**  and the maximum value is 2048  **XLOG\_BLCKSZ**, if the automatically adjusted value is less than the minimum value, the value is adjusted to the minimum value. If the automatically adjusted value is greater than the maximum value, the value is adjusted to the maximum value.
-   If this parameter is set to a value other than  **–1**  and smaller than  **4**, the value  **4**  is used.

**Default value**: 2048, 16 MB

**Setting suggestions:**  The content of the WAL buffers is written to disks at every transaction commit, so extremely large values are unlikely to provide a significant increase in system performance. However, setting this parameter to hundreds of megabytes can improve the disk write performance on a server to which a large number of transactions are committed at the same time. The default value meets user requirements in most cases.

## wal\_writer\_delay<a name="en-us_topic_0283137354_en-us_topic_0237124707_en-us_topic_0059778393_s84c1de31de80481381e554741a4ab7d7"></a>

**Parameter description**: Specifies the delay between activity rounds for the WAL writer.

>![](public_sys-resources/icon-notice.gif) **NOTICE:** 
>A longer delay might lead to insufficient WAL buffer and a shorter delay leads to continuously writing of the WALs, thereby increasing the load of disk I/O.

**Value range**: an integer ranging from 1 to 10000. The unit is millisecond.

**Default value**:  **200 ms**

## commit\_delay<a name="en-us_topic_0283137354_en-us_topic_0237124707_en-us_topic_0059778393_s4a63dd7d4d794286a990ae2123a328fd"></a>

**Parameter description**: Specifies the duration for committed data to be stored in the WAL buffer.

This parameter is a USERSET parameter. Set it based on instructions provided in  [Table 1](resetting-parameters.md#en-us_topic_0283137176_en-us_topic_0237121562_en-us_topic_0059777490_t91a6f212010f4503b24d7943aed6d846).

>![](public_sys-resources/icon-notice.gif) **NOTICE:** 
>-   When this parameter is set to a non-zero value, the committed transaction is stored in the WAL buffer instead of being written to the WAL immediately. Then the WAL writer process flushes the buffer out to disks periodically.
>-   If system load is high, other transactions are probably ready to be committed within the delay. If no other transactions are ready to be committed, the delay is a waste of time.

**Value range**: an integer ranging from 0 to 100000. The unit is μs.  **0**  indicates no delay.

**Default value**:  **0**

## commit\_siblings<a name="en-us_topic_0283137354_en-us_topic_0237124707_en-us_topic_0059778393_s107c785a61a44d39b43b4255d436e5a8"></a>

**Parameter description**: Specifies a threshold on the number of concurrent open transactions. If the number of concurrent open transactions is greater than the value of this parameter, a transaction that initiates a commit request will wait for a period of time specified by  **[commit\_delay](#en-us_topic_0283137354_en-us_topic_0237124707_en-us_topic_0059778393_s4a63dd7d4d794286a990ae2123a328fd)**. Otherwise, this transaction is written into WALs immediately.

This parameter is a USERSET parameter. Set it based on instructions provided in  [Table 1](resetting-parameters.md#en-us_topic_0283137176_en-us_topic_0237121562_en-us_topic_0059777490_t91a6f212010f4503b24d7943aed6d846).
