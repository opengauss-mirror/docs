GAUSS-00762: "foreign key constraint '%s' cannot be implemented"

SQLSTATE: 42804

Description: When foreign key constraints are added to a table, the type of constrained columns differs from that of quoted columns.

Solution: Modify the foreign key constraints to ensure that the type of constrained columns is the same as that of quoted columns.

Solution: Cancel this operation.

GAUSS-00764: "constraint '%s' of relation '%s' does not exist"

SQLSTATE: 42704

Description: When  **ALTER TABLE VALIDATE CONSTRAINT**  is run, the constraint on a table does not exist.

SQLSTATE: 42809

Description: When  **ALTER TABLE VALIDATE CONSTRAINT**  is run, the relationship constraints are not foreign key constraints or check constraints.

Solution: Modify or cancel this operation.

SQLSTATE: 42P16

Description: When  **ALTER TABLE VALIDATE CONSTRAINT**  is run to add a constraint to a parent table, the constraint is not added to the child tables.

Solution: Add the constraint to the child tables.

GAUSS-00767: "column '%s' referenced in foreign key constraint does not exist"

SQLSTATE: 42703
