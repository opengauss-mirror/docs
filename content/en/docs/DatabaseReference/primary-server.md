**Parameter description**: Specifies a comma-separated list of names of potential standby nodes that support synchronous replication.

This parameter is a SIGHUP parameter. Set it based on instructions provided in  [Table 1](../DatabaseAdministrationGuide/resetting-parameters.md#en-us_topic_0283137176_en-us_topic_0237121562_en-us_topic_0059777490_t91a6f212010f4503b24d7943aed6d846).

>![](public_sys-resources/icon-notice.gif) **NOTICE:** 
>-   The current synchronous standby node is on the top of the list. If the current synchronous standby node is disconnected, it will be replaced immediately with the next-highest-priority standby node. Name of the next-highest-priority standby node is added to the list.
>-   The standby node name can be specified by setting the environment variable  **PGAPPNAME**.

**Value range**: a string If this parameter is set to  **\***, the name of any standby node that provides synchronous replication is matched. The value can be configured in the following format:

-   ANY  *num\*sync_  \(*standby\*name_  \[, ...\]\) \[, ANY  *num\*sync_  \(*standby\*name_  \[, ...\]\)\]
-   \[FIRST\]  *num\*sync_  \(*standby\*name_  \[, ...\]\)
-   *standby\*name_  \[, ...\]

    >![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
    >-   In the preceding command,  *num\*sync_  indicates the number of standby nodes that need to wait for responses from the transaction,  *standby\*name_  indicates the name of the standby node, and FIRST and ANY specify the policies for selecting standby nodes for synchronous replication from the listed servers.
    >-   **ANY N \(dn\_instanceId1, dn\_instanceId2,...\)**  indicates that any  *N_  host names in the brackets are selected as the name list of standby nodes for synchronous replication. For example,  **ANY 1\(dn\*instanceId1, dn\_instanceId2\)**  indicates that any one of  **dn\_instanceId1**  and  **dn\_instanceId2**  is used as the standby node for synchronous replication.
    >-   **FIRST N \(dn\_instanceId1, dn\_instanceId2, ...\)**  indicates that the first N primary node names in the brackets are selected as the standby node name list for synchronous replication based on the priority. For example,  **FIRST 1 \(dn\_instanceId1, dn\_instanceId2\)**  indicates that  **dn\_instanceId1**  is selected as the standby node for synchronous replication.
    >-   The meanings of dn\_instanceId1, dn\_instanceId2, ... are the same as those of FIRST 1 \(dn\_instanceId1, dn\_instanceId2, ...\).


If you use the gs\_guc tool to set this parameter, perform the following operations:

```
gs_guc reload -Z datanode -N @NODE_NAME@ -D @DN_PATH@ -c "synchronous_standby_names='ANY NODE 1(dn_instanceId1, dn_instanceId2)'";
```

or

```
gs_guc reload -Z datanode -N @NODE_NAME@ -D @DN_PATH@ -c "synchronous_standby_names='ANY 1(AZ1, AZ2)'";
```

**Default value**:  **\***

## most\_available\_sync<a name="en-us_topic_0283137370_en-us_topic_0237124713_en-us_topic_0059777578_se53a9bce83414d17b84a9beb44dd0dda"></a>

**Parameter description:**  Specifies whether transactions on the primary node are not blocked due to faults on synchronous standby nodes. For example, if one of the two synchronous standby nodes is faulty and the other is normal, the primary node waits for the normal synchronous standby node instead of being blocked by the faulty synchronous standby node.

For another example, when the quorum protocol is executed, one primary node and three synchronous standby nodes are configured. ANY 2 \(node1, node2, and node3\) is configured. When node1 and node3 are faulty and node2 is normal, host services are not blocked.

This parameter is a SIGHUP parameter. Set it based on instructions provided in  [Table 1](../DatabaseAdministrationGuide/resetting-parameters.md#en-us_topic_0283137176_en-us_topic_0237121562_en-us_topic_0059777490_t91a6f212010f4503b24d7943aed6d846).

**Default value**:  **off**

## keep\_sync\_window<a name="section9965135135115"></a>

**Parameter description**: Specifies the delay for entering the maximum availability mode.

-   If  **most\_available\_sync**  is set to  **on**, when synchronous standby nodes are faulty in primary/standby scenarios and the number of configured synchronous standby nodes is insufficient \(for details, see the meaning of  **synchonous\_standby\_name**\), setting  **keep\_sync\_window**  will retain the maximum protection mode within the time window specified by  **keep\_sync\_window**. That is, committing transactions on the primary node is blocked, delay the primary node to enter the maximum availability mode.
-   If synchronous standby nodes recover from faults and the number of synchronous standby nodes meets the configuration requirements, transactions are not blocked.
-   You are advised to set  **keep\_sync\_window**  to 5s. This prevents the monitoring system from incorrectly reporting network instability.

This parameter is a SIGHUP parameter. Set it based on instructions provided in  [Table 1](../DatabaseAdministrationGuide/resetting-parameters.md#en-us_topic_0283137176_en-us_topic_0237121562_en-us_topic_0059777490_t91a6f212010f4503b24d7943aed6d846).

**Value range**: an integer ranging from 0 to  *INT\*MAX_. The unit is second.

-   The value  **0**  indicates that the  **keep\_sync\_window**  is not set, that is, the maximum availability mode is entered directly.
-   Other values indicate the size of the timeout window.

**Default value**:  **0**

>![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:** 
>Setting this parameter may affect the RPO. If the primary node is faulty within the configured timeout window, the data generated from the time when the primary node is blocked to the time when the primary node is faulty may be lost.

>![](public_sys-resources/icon-notice.gif) **NOTICE:** 
>-   This parameter is used for performance testing in scenarios where data synchronization to standby nodes is enabled and where it is disabled. If this parameter is set to  **off**, tests on abnormal scenarios, such as switchover and faults, cannot be performed to prevent inconsistency between the primary, standby, and secondary servers.

**Parameter description:**  Specifies the policy for synchronizing configuration files between the primary node and standby node, and between the standby node and cascaded standby node.

This parameter is a POSTMASTER parameter. Set it based on instructions provided in  [Table 1](../DatabaseAdministrationGuide/resetting-parameters.md#en-us_topic_0283137176_en-us_topic_0237121562_en-us_topic_0059777490_t91a6f212010f4503b24d7943aed6d846).

**Value range**: enumerated values

-   **all\_node**: If this parameter is set to  **all\_node**  for the primary node, the primary node is allowed to proactively synchronize configuration files to all standby nodes. If this parameter is set to  **all\_node**  for a standby node, the standby node is allowed to send synchronization requests to its primary node, and the standby node is allowed to proactively synchronize configuration files to all cascaded standby nodes. If this parameter is set to  **all\_node**  for a cascaded standby node, the current cascaded standby node is allowed to send synchronization requests to its standby node.
-   **only\_sync\_node**: If this parameter is set to  **only\_sync\_node**  for the primary node, the primary node is only allowed to proactively synchronize configuration files to all standby nodes. If this parameter is set to  **only\_sync\_node**  for a standby node, the standby node is allowed to send synchronization requests to its primary node, and the standby node is not allowed to proactively synchronize configuration files to all cascaded standby nodes. If this parameter is set to  **only\_sync\_node**  for a cascaded standby node, the current cascaded standby node is allowed to send synchronization requests to its standby node.
-   **none\_node**: If this parameter is set to  **none\_node**  for the primary node, the primary node is not allowed to proactively synchronize configuration files to all standby nodes. If this parameter is set to  **none\_node**  for a standby node, the standby node is not allowed to send synchronization requests to its primary node, and the standby node is allowed to proactively synchronize configuration files to all cascaded standby nodes. If this parameter is set to  **none\_node**  for a cascaded standby node, the current cascaded standby node is not allowed to send synchronization requests to its standby node.

**Default value:** **all\_node**

>![](public_sys-resources/icon-notice.gif) **NOTICE:** 
>-   In an openGauss database instance that contains a primary node, a standby node, and a cascaded standby node, the primary node is a sender relative to the standby node and the standby node is a receiver relative to the primary node, while the standby node is a sender relative to the cascaded standby node and the cascaded standby node is a receiver relative to the standby node.
>-   The sender actively synchronizes the configuration file to the receiver, and the receiver requests the sender to synchronize the configuration file, which are two independent events, so that the configuration files are synchronized. If you do not want to synchronize configuration files, set this parameter to  **none\_node**  on the receiver. If the sender is a standby node, set this parameter to  **none\_node**  only. If the sender is a primary node, set this parameter to  **none\_node**  when the primary node does not synchronize with any standby node; or set this parameter to  **only\_sync\_node**  when the primary node synchronizes with synchronous standby nodes only and does not synchronize with asynchronous standby nodes.
>-   To be specific, the sender sends a configuration file which directly overwrites the corresponding parameter in the configuration file of the receiver. After the policy for synchronizing configuration files is set, even if you modify configuration parameters of the receiver, the modification does not take effect because the sender immediately overwrites these parameters.
>-   The following configuration parameters are not synchronized even if the policy for synchronizing configuration files is set: application\_name, archive\_command, audit\_directory, available\_zone, comm\_control\_port, comm\_sctp\_port, listen\_addresses, log\_directory, port, replconninfo1, replconninfo2, replconninfo3, replconninfo4, replconninfo5, replconninfo6, replconninfo7, replconninfo8, replconninfo9, replconninfo10, replconninfo11, replconninfo12, replconninfo13, replconninfo14, replconninfo15, replconninfo16, replconninfo17, replconninfo18, ssl, ssl\_ca\_file, ssl\_cert\_file, ssl\_ciphers, ssl\_crl\_file, ssl\_key\_file, ssl\_renegotiation\_limit, ssl\_cert\_notify\_time, synchronous\_standby\_names, local\_bind\_address, perf\_directory, query\_log\_directory, asp\_log\_directory, streaming\_router\_port, enable\_upsert\_to\_merge, archive\_dest, recovery\_min\_apply\_delay, and sync\_config\_strategy.


## enable_save_confirmed_lsn<a name="section94339215542"></a>

**Parameter description:** If this parameter is enabled, the primary node flushes the location that has achieved majority consistency with the current synchronous standby node during each transaction to a disk. When the primary node is faulty and the original primary node functions as the standby node to initiate a build request, the system checks whether the same confirmed LSN exists on the source node (new primary node). If it does not exist, the build fails to prevent the data of the original primary node from being overwritten by the build.

This parameter is a POSTMASTER parameter. Set it based on instructions provided in [Table 1](../DatabaseAdministrationGuide/resetting-parameters.md#en-us_topic_0237121562_en-us_topic_0059777490_t91a6f212010f4503b24d7943aed6d846).

**Value range:** Boolean

-   **on**: indicates that this function is enabled. In the scenario where one primary node and multiple standby nodes are configured and a synchronous standby node is configured, each time the primary node performs a data change transaction operation (DML/DDL), and the primary node waits to reach a majority consistency location with the synchronous standby node, flushes the location that has achieved majority consistency with the current synchronous standby to disk. The persistent file corresponds to the status file of the replication slot of the synchronous standby node. If this parameter is enabled, both automatic build and incremental build in unspecified schema are affected. When the primary node is faulty and the original primary node functions as the standby node, the system checks whether the same confirmed LSN exists on the source node (new primary node). If it does not exist, the build fails to prevent the data of the original primary node from being overwritten by the build.
-   **off**: indicates that this function is disabled. The behavior of the primary node remains unchanged when a transaction is committed. The behavior of automatic build and incremental build remains unchanged. In the scenario where one primary node and multiple standby nodes are configured and asynchronous standby nodes are configured, if the primary node suddenly breaks down and the majority consistency location (such as LSN100) of the primary node is not synchronized to the asynchronous standby node, the asynchronous standby node is forcibly started as the new primary node. If some transaction operations are performed on the new primary node, the data on the new primary node overwrites LSN100. In this case, if the original primary node is used as the standby node and a build request is initiated, the primary node loses the service data of LSN100 that has reached the latest majority consistency location.

**Default value:** **off**

>![](public_sys-resources/icon-notice.gif) **NOTICE:**
>
>-   If **most\_available\_sync** is set to **on** and all synchronous standby nodes are faulty, this function does not take effect. This is because no synchronous standby can trigger the persistence of the LSN.
>
>-   This function affects only incremental build or automatic build without specifying the build mode. If you forcibly specify the full build mode, this function does not take effect.
>
>-   If files in pg\_replslot of the primary node are manually deleted or damaged before the build command is executed, this function does not take effect.
>
>-   After this function is enabled, if the primary node is stopped while waiting for the standby node to achieve majority consistency, the system does not display a message indicating that the transaction has been committed locally and may not be synchronized to the remote node. This prevents upper-layer services from considering that data has been consistent.
>
>-   After this function is enabled, the synchronization waiting time is prolonged due to persistent data. As a result, the performance of the primary and standby clusters with synchronous standby nodes is affected. According to the test data, the performance decreases by about 20% compared with that when this function is disabled.
