GAUSS-02606: "invalid byte sequence for encoding '%s': %s"

SQLSTATE: 22021

Description: Failed to recognize the character sequence.

Solution: Ensure that the data contains no unrecognizable character encoding by following the instructions provided in  [Character Set Support](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/multibyte.html)  in  [PostgreSQL Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/index.html).
