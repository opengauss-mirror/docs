## enable\_global\_syscache<a name="section97160555612"></a>

**Parameter description**: Specifies whether to enable the global system cache function. This parameter is a POSTMASTER parameter. Set it based on instructions provided in  [Table 1](../DatabaseAdministrationGuide/resetting-parameters.md#en-us_topic_0283137176_en-us_topic_0237121562_en-us_topic_0059777490_t91a6f212010f4503b24d7943aed6d846).

**Value range**: Boolean

-   **on**  indicates that the global system cache function is enabled.
-   **off**  indicates that the global system cache function is disabled.

**Default value**:  **on**

You are advised to use this parameter together with the thread pool parameter. After this parameter is enabled, you are advised to set  **wal\_level**  of the standby nnode to  **hot\_standby**  or higher if you need to access the standby node.

## global\_syscache\_threshold<a name="section787511112134"></a>

**Parameter description**: Specifies the maximum memory usage of the global system cache. If this parameter is set to a small value, memory is frequently evicted, and a large number of memory fragments cannot be recycled. As a result, memory control fails.

This parameter is a SIGHUP parameter. Set it based on instructions provided in  [Table 1](../DatabaseAdministrationGuide/resetting-parameters.md#en-us_topic_0283137176_en-us_topic_0237121562_en-us_topic_0059777490_t91a6f212010f4503b24d7943aed6d846).

The  **enable\_global\_syscache**  parameter must be enabled.

**Value range**: an integer ranging from 16384 to 1073741824. The unit is KB.

**Default value**: **163840**

Recommended calculation formula: The smaller value of the number of hot databases and the number of threads x Memory size allocated to each database. That is, `global_syscache_threshold = min(count(hot dbs),count(threads)) * memofdb`.

Note:

+ **hot dbs**: number of hot databases, that is, databases that are frequently accessed.
+ **threads**: number of threads. In thread pool mode, the value is the sum of the number of threads in the thread pool and the number of backend threads. In non-thread pool mode, the value does not need to be calculated and the number of hot databases is used.
+ **memofdb** indicates the average memory allocated to each database. The background noise memory of each database is 2 MB. Each time a table or index is added, 11 KB memory is added.
