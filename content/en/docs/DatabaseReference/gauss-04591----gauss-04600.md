GAUSS-04591: "Failed to create LLVM state object ExecutionEngine: %s"

SQLSTATE: 42704

Description: When the current module is complied, you need to mount it to an execution engine. If this execution engine fails to be created, an error is reported to prevent subsequent invalid operations.

Solution: Create the engine again or set  **enable\_codegen**  to  **off**  to complete this query.

GAUSS-04592: "Codegen failed on verifying IR function %s."

SQLSTATE: 42883

Description: The IR function obtained based on the code is invalid or has defects.

Solution: Set  **enable\_codegen**  to  **off**. Contact technical support.

GAUSS-04593: "Failed to create llvm function prototype."

SQLSTATE: XX000

Description: An error is reported because the LLVM function prototype fails to be declared.

Solution: Try again or set  **enable\_codegen**  to  **off**.

GAUSS-04595: "Unsupported LLVM debug type!\\n"

SQLSTATE: XX000

Description: Internal system error.

Solution:Contact technical support.

GAUSS-04597: "Failed on getting IR function : LLVMIRtexteq!\\n"

SQLSTATE: XX000

Description: The  **LLVMIRtexteq**  function is not found in the current LLVM module. An error is reported to avoid subsequent invalid calling.

Solution: Exclude this function from the ll file corresponding to the IR file or set  **enable\_codegen**  to  **off**.

GAUSS-04598: "Failed on getting IR function : LLVMIRtextlt!\\n"

SQLSTATE: XX000

Description: The  **LLVMIRtextlt**  function is not found in the current LLVM module. An error is reported to avoid subsequent invalid calling.

Solution: Exclude this function from the ll file corresponding to the IR file or set  **enable\_codegen**  to  **off**.

GAUSS-04599: "Failed on getting IR function : LLVMIRtextgt!\\n"

SQLSTATE: XX000

Description: The  **LLVMIRtextgt**  function is not found in the current LLVM module. An error is reported to avoid subsequent invalid calling.

Solution: Exclude this function from the ll file corresponding to the IR file or set  **enable\_codegen**  to  **off**.

GAUSS-04600: "Failed on getting IR function : LLVMIRsubstring!\\n"

SQLSTATE: XX000

Description: The  **LLVMIRsubstring**  function is not found in the current LLVM module. An error is reported to avoid subsequent invalid calling.

Solution: Exclude this function from the ll file corresponding to the IR file or set  **enable\_codegen**  to  **off**.
