SQLSTATE: 42804

Description: The type of the declared parameter is inconsistent with that of the input parameter.

Solution: Use an input parameter of the same type as the declared parameter.

GAUSS-00032: "argument declared 'anyarray' is not consistent with argument declared 'anyelement'"

SQLSTATE: 42804

Description: The array type defined does not match the types of elements in an ANY array.

Solution: Ensure that the array type defined in the query statement and the types of elements in an ANY array are correct.

SQLSTATE: 42804

Description: Array element types cannot be identified.

Solution: Ensure that the array element types in the ANY predicate are correct.

GAUSS-00036: "type matched to anynonarray is an array type: %s"

SQLSTATE: 42804

Description: The required type is not array.

Solution: Internal system error. Contact technical support.

GAUSS-00037: "type matched to anyenum is not an enum type: %s"
