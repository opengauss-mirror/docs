To ensure secure communication between nodes and enhance feature security, security hardening is required. A hardened feature can effectively defend against security attacks such as decompilation and cracking, protecting user data and privacy. It can also prevent malicious behaviors such as a cracked application being manipulated by a malicious user to perform illegal activities.
