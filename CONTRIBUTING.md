## Submit pull requests

If you are a beginner and expect this project as the gate to open source world, this tutorial is one of the best
choices for you. Just follow the guidance and you will find the pleasure to becoming a contributor.

### Step 1: Fork repository

Before making modifications of this project, you need to make sure that this project have been forked to your own
repository. It means that there will be parallel development between this repo and your own repo, so be careful
to avoid the inconsistency between these two repos.

### Step 2: Clone the remote repository

If you want to download the code to the local machine, ```git``` is the best way:
```
git clone https://your_repo_url/projectname.git
```

### Step 3: Develop code locally

To avoid inconsistency between multiple branches, we SUGGEST checking out to a new branch:
```
git checkout -b new_branch_name origin/master
```
Then you can change the code arbitrarily.

### Step 4: Push the code to the remote repository

After updating the code, you should push the update in the formal way:
```
git add .
git status (Check the update status)
git commit -m "Your commit title"
git commit --amend (Add the concrete description of your commit)
git push origin new_branch_name
```

### Step 5: Pull a request to repository

In the last step, your need to pull a compare request between your new branch and development branch. After
finishing the pull request, the CI will be automatically set up for building test.

### Pull requests format
